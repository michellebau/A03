**Glossary:**  
Branch: Is contained within the repository but allows users to work freely without disrupting the "live" version as it does not interfere with the primary or master branch. When users make the changes they want to make, they can merge their branch back into the master branch to publish your changes.  
Clone: A copy of a repository that lives on a user’s computer instead of a website's server, or the act of making that copy. Users are able to edit files in their preferred editor and use Git to manage edits so users can push their local changes to the remote to keep them synchronized when they’re online.  
Commit: An individual edit to a file (or set of files). When users make a commit to save their work, Git creates a unique ID ("SHA" or "hash") that allows them to record their specific changes committed along with who made them and when.  
Fetch: A command to add changes from the remote repository to a local working branch without committing them. Using fetch allows users to review changes before committing them to their local branch.  
GIT: An open-source program for tracking changes in text files, written by the author of the Linux operating system.  
Github: A code sharing and publishing service that facilitates a collaborative version control for programmers. It is a Git repository hosting service presented in an online platform.  
Merge: To merge is to bring changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and apply them into another. This often happens through a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line.  
Merge Conflict: Occurs when collaborators make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one collaborator edits a file and another collaborator deletes the same file. The merge conflict must be resolved before you can merge the branches.  
Push: A command to send committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com.  
Pull: A command to fetch in changes and merge them. Using pull won’t allow users to review changes before committing them to their local branch.  
Remote: The version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.  
Repository: Stores all of a project’s files and each file’s revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
